# BeadImageProcessor
The Bead Image Processor is a project we (Humberto Torralba, Manuel Torralba, Jatin Kulkarni, and Anthony Ceja) submitted to HackTX 2021.

Currently a user can upload an image of a bead pattern they want to loom and specify the number of repititions for the project.
The Java program parses through the image and creates an array of the colors in the correct order needed to loom.
It has been optimized to work with the limited memory on the Arduino.

We plan to continue this project and update the Arduino code once we create the physical machine to auto load the string with the correct beads passed in from the Java program.
